# Data-Professions-Survey-Dashboard
Hello! This is a PowerBI dashboard I created during one of my courses. The instructor of the course conducted a survey that was sent to those in data professions. This survey contained quesitons about the viewers careers as well as demographic information about themselves. During the course the instructor gave us data set and some ideas to clean up the data. It was up to us to create the dashboard visualization on our own, and this was what I came up with. Unfortunately, I do not have a complete PowerBI account, so I cannot share the interactive version of the dashboard. This was my first PowerBI project; I know there is much room to improve, thank you for checking it out!
